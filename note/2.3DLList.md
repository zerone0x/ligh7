# ALList

1. cause we need to access every node quickly, not only near the sentinel
2. size is an issue, how to resize array
   1. when add one, we resize +1
   2. its too slow when add many(ex. 100w) num to array
   3. how could we handle?
      1. use *2 every time resize
3. Generally unify the type --> ``` Item[] new Object[100] ```
4. expose the unused loitering memory --> null
