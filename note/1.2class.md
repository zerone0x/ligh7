1. javac array.java && java array
   1. compiler --> interpreter
2. method runs in class 
   1. and class must in main class
3. create a instance by other class(not static)
   1. use another class's method
   2. give the data(instance variable) to this referred class
      1. or you can make a constructor to this instance, then convey the data by constructor method 
         1. data - constructor - instance
            1. just like __init__ in python
4. Array can holds many objects
5. If you want to visit other methods, you need to make this method be not **static**
   1. Then, the static method can only be used by class
   2. No static method can be used by instance
6. use class to constrain the complexity
7.
